Write a JavaScript function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. Make sure your function can handle negative integers as well.

Write a JavaScript function that takes two integers as input and returns their product. Make sure your function can handle negative integers as well.

Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as input and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers up to n.

Write a JavaScript function that takes two integers as input and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder.

Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as input and checks if it is prime. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the average of the numbers in the array. Make sure your function can handle empty arrays.

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the median of the numbers in the array. The median is the middle number when the array is sorted in ascending order. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the mode of the numbers in the array. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the array. If there are multiple modes, return the smallest one.

Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as input and returns the sum of its digits. For example, the sum of the digits of 123 is 6 (1 + 2 + 3).

Write a JavaScript function that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder.
